## The palest ink is better than the best memory.

I always like to research something that I interested in, but it would not be long before I forgot. So I decided to open up this blog to record my life and my research.

## Leave something from the past.

Time passes like stream. I can not touch it, and I can not see it. But I can make something remain, such as these article, these codes...

I think maybe after a decade when I saw these, I can remember something.

## Practice my writing

I have not been doing my homework for almost 3 years. If I still be like this, I am afraid I would become a wreck. So I want to make up for something. :)
