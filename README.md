# CODEFAULTS.GITHUB.IO - A magical blog

<a href="http://codefaults.com">Click me to visit the blog</a>

Just a blog hosted on github.io.

**You may have some questions:**

## What can I find here?

Okay, this is a very good question, but the answer is **nothing**.

## What is your purpose for creating this blog?

For journaling things in life, writing things about coding and my interests&hellip;

## Why do you choose to host this blog on github.io?

WWWWhat??? Isn't it so obvious??? **It is sure the cheapest way!!!** For me, a poor high-school student, getting a server is expensive, even if it is just 30RMB per month.
Moreover, I don't save any money at all.

Not only that, but also I think writing with git is natural and simple.

## How often will you update your blog?

I am afraid that I can't tell you how often. As soon as I have free time, I will update my blog.
